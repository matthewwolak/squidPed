\arguments{
\item{years}{number of time steps}

\item{n_females}{starting number of breeding females}

\item{afr}{age at first reproduction}

\item{p_breed}{probability that a female breeds}

\item{fecundity}{number of juveniles a female produces each year}

\item{fixed_fecundity}{logical. is fecundity fixed or drawn from a Poisson distribution}

\item{juv_surv}{survival of juveniles until local recruitment, where recruitment is defined as having genetic offspring}

\item{adult_surv}{survival of adults across years}

\item{immigration}{yearly immigration, as a proportion of starting number of females (n_females)}

\item{p_polyandry}{probability that a female has any polyandry}

\item{p_sire}{probability that 'social' male sires all offspring}

\item{p_retain}{probability that social partnership is retained}

\item{constant_pop}{Logical. Should there be stochastic variation in population size}

\item{known_age_structure}{Currently not in use}
